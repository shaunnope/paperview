Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War -- its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral , constitutional , and political crisis . In doing so , he preserved the Union , paved the way to the abolition of slavery , strengthened the federal government , and modernized the economy .   Born in Hodgenville , Kentucky , Lincoln grew up on the western frontier in Kentucky and Indiana . Largely self-educated , he became a lawyer in Illinois , a Whig Party leader , and was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives , in which he served for eight years . Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846 , Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks , tariffs , and railroads . Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress , and because his opposition to the Mexican -- American War was unpopular among Illinois voters , Lincoln returned to Springfield and resumed his successful law practice . Reentering politics in 1854 , he became a leader in building the new Republican Party , which had a statewide majority in Illinois . In 1858 , while taking part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival , Democrat Stephen A. Douglas , Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery , but lost the U.S. Senate race to Douglas .   In 1860 , Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state . Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the South , he swept the North and was elected president in 1860 . Lincoln 's victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House -- no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession . Subsequently , on April 12 , 1861 , a Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the Union . As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party , Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans , who demanded harsher treatment of the South , War Democrats , who called for more compromise , anti-war Democrats -LRB- called Copperheads -RRB- , who despised him , and irreconcilable secessionists , who plotted his assassination . Politically , Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other , by carefully planned political patronage , and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory . His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism , republicanism , equal rights , liberty , and democracy .   Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war . His primary goal was to reunite the nation . He suspended habeas corpus , leading to the controversial ex parte Merryman decision , and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the Trent Affair in late 1861 . Lincoln closely supervised the war effort , especially the selection of top generals , including his most successful general , Ulysses S. Grant . He also made major decisions on Union war strategy , including a naval blockade that shut down the South 's normal trade , moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee , and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system . Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond ; each time a general failed , Lincoln substituted another , until finally Grant succeeded . As the war progressed , his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 ; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves , encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery , and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which permanently outlawed slavery .   An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state , Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election . Anticipating the war 's conclusion , Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness . On April 14 , 1865 , five days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee , Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth , a Confederate sympathizer .   Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents . "}

{"index":46326,"id":"Dissociative_identity_disorder","text":"Dissociative identity disorder -LRB- DID -RRB- , also known as multiple personality disorder -LRB- MPD -RRB- , is a mental disorder characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring identities or dissociated personality states . These states alternately show in a person 's behavior , accompanied by memory impairment for important information not explained by ordinary forgetfulness . These symptoms are not accounted for by substance abuse , seizures , or other medical conditions , nor by imaginative play in children . Dissociative symptoms range from common lapses in attention , becoming distracted by something else , and daydreaming , to pathological dissociative disorders . Symptoms vary over time .   Dissociative disorders , including DID , have been attributed to disruptions in memory caused by trauma or other forms of stress . Research on this hypothesis has been characterized by poor methodology . An alternative hypothesis is that DID is a by-product of techniques employed by some therapists , especially those using hypnosis , and disagreement between the two positions is characterized by intense debate . DID is one of the most controversial psychiatric disorders , with no clear consensus on diagnostic criteria or treatment . No systematic , empirically supported definition of `` dissociation '' exists . Diagnosis is often difficult , as the entity is frequently associated with other mental disorders . Differential diagnosis should consider malingering if the individual 's principal concern is with financial or forensic gain or with the avoidance of obligations ; and factitious disorder , if the individual 's principal concern is with assuming a patient role .   It is generally believed that DID rarely resolves spontaneously . In general , the prognosis is poor , especially for those with comorbid disorders . There is little systematic data on rates of the condition . It is believed to affect between 1 % and 3 % of the general population , and between 1 % and 5 % in inpatient groups in Europe and North America . DID is diagnosed more frequently in North America than in the rest of the world , and is diagnosed three to nine times more often in females than in males . Rates of diagnoses increased greatly in the latter half of the 20th century , along with the number of identities -LRB- often referred to as `` alters '' -RRB- claimed by people -LRB- increasing from an average of two or three to approximately 16 -RRB- .   DID is also controversial within the legal system , where it has been used as a rarely successful form of the insanity defense . The 1990s showed a parallel increase in the number of court cases involving the diagnosis . DID became a popular diagnosis in the 1970s , '80s , and '90s , but it is unclear whether the actual rate of the disorder increased , whether it was more recognized by health care providers , or whether sociocultural factors caused an increase in therapy-induced -LRB- iatrogenic -RRB- presentations . The unusual number of diagnoses after 1980 , clustered around a small number of clinicians , and the suggestibility characteristic of those with DID , support the hypothesis that DID is therapist-induced . The unusual clustering of diagnoses has also been explained as due to a lack of awareness and training among clinicians to recognize cases of DID . "}
